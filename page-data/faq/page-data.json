It provides more stable data transmission than 2.4GHz according to our experience in various use cases.</li>\n<li><em>Change the channel of Wi-Fi</em> in your router setting. Do not use channels which your neighbors’ routers are already using.</li>\n<li><em>Hide the Wi-Fi SSID</em> on the router setting.
